method of choice if usb<->sata adapter is too slow for direct boot (mine (Logilink) comes up after 9(!) sec)
do not duplicate sd card while in use (i.e. don't do this on the pi)
use dd to copy partitions from sd card to external drive:
  dd if=/dev/sda of=name_of_image
  dd if=name_of_image of=/dev/name_of_device
to check progress while dd'ing: send SIGUSR1 to dd process:
  get pid of dd (ps -ef | grep dd)
  kill -USR1 pid
make sure UUID and PARTUID of duplicated partitions are unique (they will be identical after duplication)
  tune2fs -U random /dev/name_of_device_partition_number_2 (part #1 is boot partition) (for UUID)
  fdisk /dev/name_of_device_partition_number_2 (for PARTUUID)
    go to expert mode (x)
    change identifier (i) (e.g. last digit)
    exit expert mode
    commit changes (w)
change root drive on sd card (to new PARTUUID or UUID)
  dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=8f1eafaf-02 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait
change fstab on external drive (which is root partition, now, to new PARTUUID or UUID)
  UUID=b20dd4ef-2abf-407f-bb36-7b032b7d37f7  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
 
re-insert sd card and plug in external device
boot

resize root partition (assuming external drive has a larger capacity than sd card)
  parted (do it..)
