If ssh login fails: QoS may be the culprit.
Symptom: Login prompt is displayed, nothing happens after entering password.
Solution is from 
https://expresshosting.net/ssh-hanging-authentication/

Edit the two configuration files for the Raspberry Pi:

/etc/ssh/ssh_config
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

And add the following line to the bottom of the configuration file:

IPQoS 0x00

And restart sshd (sudo service sshd restart).

The problem is caused by my Netgear Smart (or not so) managed switch.
Without it, everything is fine. 

As stated in the solution: Pain to track down.
