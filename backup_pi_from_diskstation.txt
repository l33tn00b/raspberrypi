Basic instructions:

We have to make amendments...
* There is no way (anymore) to create directories directly under a volume (?)
 * So we need to make these in admin's home
 * The path will read /volume1/homes/admin/backups
* On the Pi which is to be backed up: authorized_keys needs to be owned by root


Our script therefore reads:

SERVER=$1
ADDRESS=$2
NOW=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
LOGFILE="$SERVER-$NOW.log"
ping $ADDRESS -c 30 >> /volume1/homes/admin/backups/logs/$LOGFILE
/usr/bin/rsync -av --delete --exclude-from=/volume1/homes/admin/backups/_scripts/rsync-exclude.txt -e "ssh -p 22" root@$ADDRESS:/ /volume1/homes/admin/backups/$SERVER/ >> /volume1/homes/admin/backups/logs/$LOGFILE 2>&1
